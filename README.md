# Rest
---
>REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used. Roy Fielding developed the REST architectural style in parallel with HTTP 1.1 of 1996â€“1999, based on the existing design of HTTP 1.0 of 1996.

>REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications. The idea is that, rather than using complex mechanisms such as CORBA, RPC or SOAP to connect between machines, simple HTTP is used to make calls between machines.

### six constraints are:
1. Uniform Interface
  It simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve independently.
  Stateless
2. Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary for the server to understand the request, and cannot take advantage of any stored context on the server. Session state is therefore kept entirely on the client.
3. Cacheable
4. Client-Server
5. Layered System
